## Zencephalon Meteor Wiki

This is a super lightweight and fast wiki for my website. It has a feature I feel a lot of wikis neglect: easy linking to existing pages through autocomplete. It features a branching revision tree and version diffing. It also has several editing features tailored to my workflow.
